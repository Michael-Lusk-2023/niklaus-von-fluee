                        <hr>
                        <p>In 1417 Niklaus von Flüe was born as the eldest son of wealthy peasants in the village of Flüeli near Sachseln. In 1431 or
                        1432 he was admitted as a member of the free peasants of Obwalden, following his father in farming the alpine foothills at Flüeli, high above Lake
                        Sarnen.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>In 1438 Niklaus enrolled in the military of the Old Swiss Confederacy, and rose to the rank of captain. He distinguished
                        himself in the Old Zürich War, a conflict with Canton Zürich over the estate of Count Friedrich VII of Toggenburg.
                        Niklaus fought, it is said, with a sword in one hand and a rosary in the other.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>Upon leaving military service in 1444, Niklaus returned to Flüeli, marrying Dorothee Wyss the following year.
                        Niklaus' and Dorothee's family grew to ten children, living together in the timber farmhouse built by Niklaus. Dorothee may
                        have played a pivotal role in Niklaus' spiritual development.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>Following his return to civilian life, Niklaus became a councillor of Canton Obwalden. In 1459 he accepted appointment
                        as a judge, and served in that office for nine years. Niklaus declined to serve as governor of Obwalden. He experienced a
                        vision which spoke of worldly cares devouring his connection to God.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>In 1467 Niklaus, then aged 50, left his family with Dorothee's consent to become a hermit. He first made a pilgrimage towards the
                        Rhine. A legend tells that he turned back to settle as a hermit in the Ranft Gorge, just a few minutes from his
                        house, after experiencing a vision in the Windental above Liestal.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>Niklaus became a celebrity. It is said that he fasted for 20 years until his death in 1487. His counsel
                        of peace prevailed in the inter-cantonal conflict that threatened to break the Swiss Confederation in 1481. Innocent X
                        canonized him in 1649, leading to his recognition as Switzerland's patron saint.</p>
