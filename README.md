# [Niklaus von Flüe](README.md)

*Niklaus von Flüe* is a site that provides prospective tourists and pilgrims with introductory information and resources in connection with the eponymous hermit, hero, and patron saint of Switzerland.

In particular, *Niklaus von Flüe* presently comprises:
- outline biographical information about Niklaus von Flüe;
- an English translation of Niklaus von Flüe's well-known prayer;
- a gallery providing impressions of relevant cultural artefacts in the region of Sachseln, Switzerland; and

It is planned further to develop the site to link directly to an existing commercial guided tour and to each of the foundations, churches and museums which administer access to heritage places in relation to Niklaus von Flüe. In a later development stage, the website may be extended further to include a literature list and copies of scholarly publications which are difficult to access.

*Niklaus von Flüe* will serve tourists and pilgrims by providing a central hub for accessing practical information and resources related to Niklaus von Flüe. It additionally should serve the relevant tour operater, foundations, churches, and museums by directing customers towards them.
